He spoke very slowly and without much volume. It was difficult for him to construct whole sentences, until at the age of 9 he began to speak normally. A compass sparked his interest in science.When Einstein was 5 years old and sick in bed, his father gave him a compass and the little boy was fascinated that the needle always pointed to the same place. This made him understand that there were forces that drove things where there was apparently nothing.",
